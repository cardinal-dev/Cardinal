<h1>Cardinal</h1>

Cardinal is an open source Cisco access point controller. Cardinal uses a LAMP stack for the frontend, and Python to handle the configuration of access points via SSH. In order to use Cardinal, your Cisco AP's must be in autonomous mode (K9W7 IOS) and have SSH enabled. 

<h2>Why Cardinal?</h2>
Cardinals are beautiful, majestic birds. People say that Cardinals represent loved ones who have passed. When Cardinals visit you, they carry love and remembrance. When I developed Cardinal, I thought of one person, in particular, who loved the red birds. I would go visit a woman in a nursing home, who loved Cardinals. This woman was exceptionally benevolent and a beautiful soul. Her humor and smile lit up the room every time I would visit. Even though I didn’t know her for a long time, knowing her for the length I did was a privilege. Unfortunately, this beautiful woman passed away in 2013.
In her memory, I decided to name my project after her. Because she loved Cardinals so much, I thought it would be fitting to name my open source Cisco access point controller, Cardinal.
I intend to post more about my road to developing Cardinal. Cardinal is still in-development, to this day. Cardinal definitely needs work! I will admit this! I am not an expert programmer/developer. However, I'm going to work very hard at bettering Cardinal! I hope that one day Cardinal becomes an open source competitor to Cisco WCS.
Thank you and I hope to see Cardinal reach far and wide!

If anyone is interested in contributing to Cardinal, please contact me! Cardinal definitely needs a better frontend! I also know that some of the SSH & MySQL operations can be much more efficient. Please contribute by opening an Issue on Cardinal's GitHub repo or by messaging me at cardinal-dev@mcclunetechnologies.net. 

To the first two contributors, I will send you a Cardinal t-shirt! (black shirt with the Cardinal logo on front)

This is for you, Chris.
