<h1>Cardinal</h1>

Cardinal is an open source Cisco access point controller. Cardinal is built on Python and uses `paramiko` to handle the configuration of access points via SSH. In order to use Cardinal, your Cisco AP's must be in autonomous mode (K9W7 IOS) and have SSH enabled. 

<h2>Why Cardinal?</h2>
Cardinals are majestic birds. People say that Cardinals represent loved ones who have passed. When Cardinals visit you, they carry love and remembrance. When I developed Cardinal, I thought of one person, in particular, who loved the red bird. I once knew a woman in a nursing home who loved cardinals. This woman was exceptionally benevolent and a beautiful soul. Her humor and smile lit up the room every time I would visit. Even though I didn’t know her for a long time, knowing her for the length I did was an honor. Unfortunately, she passed away in 2013.
In her memory, I decided to name my project after her. Because she loved Cardinals so much, I thought it would be fitting to name my open source Cisco access point controller, Cardinal. I intend to post more about my road to developing Cardinal. Cardinal is still in-development, to this day. Cardinal definitely needs work! As I build Cardinal, I learn more and more about programming and application development. I hope that one day Cardinal becomes an open source alternative to the Cisco WLC.<br>

If anyone is interested in contributing to Cardinal, please contact me! Cardinal definitely needs a better frontend! I also know that some of the SSH & MySQL operations can be more efficient. Please contribute by opening an Issue on Cardinal's GitHub repo or by messaging me at cardinal-dev@mcclunetechnologies.net.<br>
