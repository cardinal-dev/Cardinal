Cardinal is an open source Cisco access point controller. Cardinal is built
on the LAMP stack, and uses Python to handle the configuration of
access points via SSH.

Cardinals are beautiful, majestic birds. People say that Cardinals
represent loved ones who have passed. When Cardinals visit you, they
carry love and remembrance. When I developed Cardinal, I thought of one
person, in particular, who loved the red birds. I would go visit a woman
in a nursing home, who loved Cardinals. This woman was exceptionally
benevolent and a beautiful soul. Her humor and smile lit up the room
every time I would visit. Even though I didn't know her for a long time,
knowing her for the length I did was a privilege. Unfortunately, this
beautiful woman passed away in 2013.

In her memory, I decided to name my project after her. Because she loved
Cardinals so much, I thought it would be fitting to name my open source
Cisco access point controller, Cardinal.

I intend to post more about my road to developing Cardinal. Cardinal is
still in-development, to this day. I hope one day that Cardinal will be
an open source competitor to the Cisco WCS application. However, I will
be extremely happy if even one person contributes!

Thank you and I hope to see Cardinal reach far and wide!

This is for you, Chris.
