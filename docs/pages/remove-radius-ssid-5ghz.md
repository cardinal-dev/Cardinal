The Cardinal **Delete RADIUS SSID (5GHz)** tile is where an user can
delete an existing 5GHz 802.1x SSID from a Cardinal managed AP.

This will send a series of SSH commands that will delete the SSID
configurations from AP. If you wish to perform this action, on a wider
scale, please use the **Delete RADIUS SSID (5GHz) (Group)** tile. Please
make sure you create an access point group before utilizing this
feature.
