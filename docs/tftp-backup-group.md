===================

The Cardinal **TFTP Backup (Group)**tile is where an user can backup a
whole group of access point configurations via TFTP (Trivial File
Transfer Protocol). The user simply enters the IP address of the TFTP
server.  Then, Cardinal will open a connection to every access point in
an AP group, and backup the configuration per the user's input.

**TFTP IP** - The IP address of the TFTP server.

*Because Cardinal will backup all configurations in an access point
group, I deemed it wise to let the access point keep the default file
name.*
