Well, to install Cardinal, it would be best if you had a Linux system. I
used Ubuntu 14.04.2 when I developed Cardinal, and it worked fine for
me. However, that doesn't mean you couldn't use CentOS, Red Hat, etc. As
long as you can run the system dependencies, you should be good to go!

***IMPORTANT: Cardinal is still in-development! Please create a separate
VM for testing Cardinal! I would hate for someone to mess up a
production system using Cardinal.***

***Cardinal only works with Cisco AP's that have the K9W7 (autonomous
mode) image installed. ***

**Linux Distros That Run Cardinal Successfully (as of 11/3/2017):**

-   Ubuntu 14.04
-   Debian 8.9 (Jessie)

**Cisco Access Points That Work With Cardinal:**

-   Cisco Aironet C1142N
-   Cisco Aironet C3702I
