The **Delete 2.4GHz SSID from Cardinal** tile allows an user to delete
an existing SSID from Cardinal's database, **NOT** the AP. If you wish
to delete the SSID from the AP, please use the **Delete SSID** tiles.

This will delete the SSID from Cardinal, completely. If you are going to
wipe the SSID out completely, I would recommend first deleting the SSIDs
from the AP's. Then, I would delete the SSID from Cardinal. Currently,
there is no way to see which AP's have a certain SSID associated to it.
I am working on that feature.
